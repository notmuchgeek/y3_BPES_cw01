- Strengths and weaknesses of the valuation technique
- An assessment of factors causing current over/under-valuation of the S&P index relative to your estimate of fair value.

Your group submission should be 2000 words (4 pages) or less. Graphs, tables and calculations to be included in the appendix (not to be included in the word count).
